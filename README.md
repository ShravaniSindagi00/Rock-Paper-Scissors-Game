# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game, where a user plays against the computer. The user selects one of the three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the computer randomly selects one. The game compares the user's and computer's choices, displays the result, and keeps track of the score.

 Features:
- User-friendly interface
- Randomized computer moves
- Score tracking for both the user and computer
- Real-time results after each round
